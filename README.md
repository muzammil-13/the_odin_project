# The Odin Project - Learning Repository

This repository contains my progress through The Odin Project curriculum, including completed exercises and projects as I learn web development.

## Contents

### Projects

* **Rock Paper Scissors** : A JavaScript implementation of the classic game, played through the console. Located in `Foundations_Course/repos/Rock_Paper_Scissors-odin/`.

### Exercises

* **CSS Exercises** : A collection of CSS challenges designed to build and test CSS skills. Located in `Foundations_Course/css-exercises-odin/`.
* **JavaScript Exercises** : A series of JavaScript problems with test-driven development approach. Located in `Foundations_Course/javascript-exercises-odin/`.

## How to Use This Repository

### Rock Paper Scissors

Open `index.html` in your browser and use the console to play the game. The JavaScript logic is implemented in `script.js`.

### CSS Exercises

1. Navigate to an exercise directory
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser
3. Make edits to the CSS files to match the desired outcome shown in the exercise README

### JavaScript Exercises

1. Navigate to an exercise directory using `cd exerciseName`
2. Run `npm test exerciseName.spec.js` to see the test requirements
3. Edit the JavaScript file to make the tests pass
4. Once complete, compare your solution with the provided solution in the `solutions` directory

## Learning Approach

This repository follows The Odin Project's learning philosophy:

1. Plan or pseudocode solutions before implementation
2. Write code to solve the problem
3. Test the code to ensure it works as expected
4. Commit changes regularly with descriptive commit messages

## Acknowledgments

All exercises and project requirements are from [The Odin Project](command:_cody.vscode.open?%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theodinproject.com%2F%22), a free open-source curriculum for learning web development.
